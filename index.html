<h3><strong>Engine</strong></h3>


<p class="P-Class">This vehicle is one wild and impresive vehicle and my personal favorate. 
First we will look at the heart of this beast. The Jesko features a twin turbocharged 
5.0-leter V8 gernerating 1280 horsepower and 1106 lb-ft of torque on pump gas. 
On E85, the output jumps up to around 1600 horsepower. The Koenigsegg Jesko vehicle has been claimed 
it's engine the lightest V8 ever made.</p>

<h3><strong>Transmission</strong></h3>

<p class="P-Class">With my brain overloaded with power lets move on to the gearbox of this vehicle. The Jesko comes 
with an amazing nine-speed gearbox and is also very light and reffered to as the Light Speed Transmission or LST for short.
Built by Koenigsegg, the LST features a dual-clutch.</p> 

<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>

<p class="P-Class">The Jesko also comes with an exclusive rear-wheel-steering system witch heightens performance. This improves steering 
ability and boost stability. The last major factor in this section is the downforce. The Jesko can produce around 1760-pounds of downforce 
at 250 kph(155 mph) and around 3100-pounds at higher speeds along with around 3150-pound curb weight.
Overall the power and performance are just amazing to read but i never doubted this amazing vehicle.<!--Talking about clutch on caranddriver.com(should be saved in safari on phone)--></p>
